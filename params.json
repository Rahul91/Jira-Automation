While committing your code, it first shows your diff and then asks you to proceed, therefore eliminating the chance of wrong commit.\r\n2. Ticket no. is automatically apeneded in the commit message, which is a good practise.\r\n3. Will work for git, svn and mercurial without having to write the hooks for doing the same.\r\n4. Every step can be logged. for later debugging, if required.\r\n5. While committing, there is a option of specifying files with -f option.\r\n6. Reduce rework of logging your work in ticket assigned to you.\r\n\r\n#Working:\r\n1. Make an alias of the script, or just execute it once, it will create it. It will create a alias of jal(jira automated logging)\r\n2. Thats it !!!\r\n\r\n3. Just go to any directory with a git or svn project, just write the command name and it will start working.\r\nIt will start diffing all your modified code, and asks one-by-one, if you want to commit or not. Just write\r\n                  \r\n                  $ jal\r\n\r\n4. You can specify files if you need, by \r\n                  \r\n                  $ jal -f file1 file2 file3 ....\r\n\r\n5.

And if there is nothing to commit, just go in any directory which is not an active git, svn or mercurial directory and just hit for command\r\n                  \r\n                  $ jal\r\n\r\n8. This time, it will prompt your ticket, you can enter time spent and worklog message, and it will be logged.\r\n\r\n9.
